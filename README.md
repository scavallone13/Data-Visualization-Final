# Data-Visualization-Final
Tulane University Grad Student Final Project 

To preface, my grad student final project is an amalgamation of my working through the problems, so any errors encountered were left in because it was part of the development process. Much of this project was trial and error, as the data types, missing data and other aspects consistently produced new challenges to overcome. This was just the most recent version of the project code. 

The code is in the .py format, all that is needed is a jupyter notebook and the code can be downloaded and uploaded as is. All packages needed to run the project are included in the cells. There is only one page in the repository outside of the read me, and that is the source code.
